# Enemigo
As per the theme of our game i.e "you are your own enemy " we have named our game as "Enemigo". A word play on enemy and go. 


Enemigo is a single character game in which character's own shadow acts as it's enemy. When the character comes in contact of the shadow, game ends there and it is restarted.
